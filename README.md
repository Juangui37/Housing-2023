# Housing-2023
This is a quick Data Science project where I will use a data scraping tool created by cullenwatson ( Bunsly/HomeHarvest ). I will use this tool to scrape recent housing data from Redin to create Classification &amp; Regression models to get insights on houses within a 15 mile radius of Travelers in Connecticut.
